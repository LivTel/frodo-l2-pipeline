# DELETE COMMENT LINES BEFORE USE
# structure (one entry per line) is:
#
# path to arc.lis file (relative to reference_arcs/[blue||red]_[g||vph]/ folder)
# \t
# date valid from (dd/mm/yyyy)
# \t
# time valid from (HH:MM:SS)
# \t
# date valid to (dd/mm/yyyy)
# \t
# time valid to (HH:MM:SS)

# alternativey, the special token "now" can be used instead of BOTH of the "valid to" fields to indicate that this list is to be used indefinitely
