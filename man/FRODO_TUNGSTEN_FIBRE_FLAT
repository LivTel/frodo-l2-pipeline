Synopsis:

Use tungstem lamp spectra to generate and apply flat field correction

This function exists to work around a specific issue on Frodo Red (bug #2645)
and is not intended for more generalised use in a generic spectral pipeline.

Description:

Where the generic CCD flat field is insufficient to sample the response of the CCD an 
observation of a tungsten lamp can be used to specifically sample the exact same pixels as are 
used to extract the target data tramlines. A tungsten lamp is required that was obtained in
identical conditions to the target frame, close in time and optical bench temperature because
it is only possible to extract the flat from the specific pixels that get illuminated so the
resulting flat is only valid when tungten and target are very well matched.

The fibre extracted tungsten spectra are normalised against the mean spectral shape of the 
tungsten lamp so the spectral response of lamp and spectrogaph are removed leaving only the pixel-
to-pixel variation in throughput. To do this the mean tungsten spectrum is estimated and then
divided into each of the 144 fibres.

That normalised file is then used a flat field to correct the target file.

No extra command line options are required. Optional parameters are

  -e which attempts to match the total throughput of the fibres before doing any of the above
  
  -l which uses a stronger smoothing function, optimised to Red-Low. The default parameters 
     without this option still perform adequate results on Red-Low and Red-High.
